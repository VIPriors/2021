We solicit submissions that in the broad sense focus on achieving data efficiency through incorporating prior knowledge of the visual domain into network design. This includes the following topics:

- Pre-wired invariance/equivariance to symmetries, such as translation, rotation, scaling, etc.
- Parameter sharing for data efficiency
- (Meta-)learning symmetries from data
- Unsupervised learning through visual priors, e.g. contrastive learning
- Color invariants/constants in Deep Learning
- Data augmentation
- Human vision as an inspiration for data-efficient vision algorithms, e.g. reducing texture bias in Convolutional Neural Networks, modeling network operations after human vision, etc.
- Alternative data-efficient operators for Deep Learning inspired by visual inductive priors, e.g. alternative compact filter bases, Capsule Networks, etc.

Please note that this list is not exhaustive! We strongly encourage novel approaches to data efficient methods using visual prior knowledge.

### Accepted works

**Decisions are out!** Please find the list of accepted works on [our OpenReview page](https://openreview.net/group?id=thecvf.com/ICCV/2021/Workshop/VIPriors).

### Submissions

Submissions are sollicited through OpenReview. Reviewing will be double-blind. We do not have a discussion/rebuttal period. The top accepted papers will be invited to orally present their work during the workshop.

Accepted papers will be published in ICCV 2021 Workshop proceedings. Submissions must follow [the ICCV 2021 submission format](http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/node/4#submission-guidelines). Optional supplementary material can be submitted through OpenReview (single .zip file, maximum of 50MB). The deadline for supplementary material is the same as the paper submission deadline.

<!-- <a class='btn btn--primary btn--large' style='background-color: #00a8d6;' href='https://openreview.net/group?id=thecvf.com/ICCV/2021/Workshop/VIPriors'>Submit your work</a> -->

**Timeline**

- ~~(ICCV paper notifications: July 22nd, 2021)~~
- ~~Submission deadline: July 25th, 2021, 23:59 GMT~~
- ~~Author notifications: August 7th, 2021~~
- CMT submission deadline: August 10th, 2021, 23:59 GMT
- Camera-ready deadline: ~~August 14th~~ August 17th, 2021, 23:59 GMT

**Please note**: we will require authors of accepted papers to submit their paper on CMT as well. This is because we found out too late that ICCV requires us to use CMT instead of OpenReview because of proceedings copyright requirements. Please be prepared to submit your accepted paper (not the camera-ready version) to CMT ASAP after notification. You will then receive instructions on preparing the camera-ready version through CMT. Please find our CMT site here: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/VIPriors2021](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/VIPriors2021).

## Call for posters

Authors of recent and relevant works (including works accepted at the main ICCV 2021 conference paper track) are invited to present a **poster** of their work at our workshop. Please apply by sending an email to [vipriors-ewi@tudelft.nl](mailto:vipriors-ewi@tudelft.nl) before **August 14th, 2021**.
