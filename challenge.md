We present the **"Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Computer Vision"** challenges. We offer four challenges, where models are to be trained from scratch, and we reduce the number of training samples to a fraction of the full set. The winners of each challenge are invited to present their winning method at the VIPriors workshop presentation at ICCV 2021. The four data-deficient challenges are:

1. Image classification;
2. Semantic segmentation;
3. Object detection;
4. Action recognition;

These tasks were chosen to encourage researchers of arbitrary background to participate: no giant GPU clusters are needed, nor will training for a long time yield much improvement over the baseline results.

In addition to an award for the top submission by performance, this year will see the introduction of an additional jury-based prize for the most interesting submission.

*Further details, such as the datasets for each task, will be announced soon.*

## Important dates

- Challenges open: estimated end of June 2021;
- Challenges close: September 17th, 2021;
- Technical reports due: September 24th, 2021;
- Winners announced: October 1st, 2021.

## Data

*TBA*

## Rules

- We prohibit the use of other data than the provided training data, i.e., **no pre-training**, no transfer learning.
- For submissions on CodaLab to qualify to the challenge we require the authors submit either a **technical report** or a full paper about their final submission. See details below under "Report". Submissions without a report or paper associated do not qualify to the competition.
- Top contenders in the challenge may be required to submit their submissions to peer review to ensure reproducability and that the rules of the challenge were followed. The organizers will contact contenders for this when necessary after the challenges close.
- Organizers retain the right to disqualify any submissions that violate these rules.

## Report

For the submission on CodaLab to qualify for the competition, we require the authors to submit a technical report of at least three pages about the submission. The deadline for these reports is September 24th, the same date as the workshop paper deadline. Authors are to submit their report to ArXiv and submit the link to us using the form linked below. Those unable to submit to Arxiv can email their report to [the emailaddress listed under "Organizers"](/#organizers). Please use the same format as for the paper track. After the conference we will publish the links to the technical reports on the workshop website.

Authors that are already submitting a paper about the submission to the workshop paper track are not required to submit a technical report. Instead, they are to use the same submission form to refer the challenge organizers to their submitted paper.

*Report submission instructions are TBA.*

## Submission

Each of the four challenges are hosted on CodaLab, a public platform for AI challenges. Submissions must be made by uploading files containing predictions according to the format defined in the toolkit (see *Resources* for details) to the challenge pages listed below.

*The challenge pages are TBA.*

## Resources

To accommodate submissions to the challenges we provide a toolkit that contains

- Python tools for generating the appropriate training and validation data;
- documentation of the required submission format for the challenges;
- implementations of the baseline models for each challenge.

<!-- See [the GitHub repository of the toolkit here](https://github.com/VIPriors/vipriors-challenges-toolkit). -->

*The toolkit will be made available shortly.*

<!-- ## Questions

If you have any questions, please first check the Frequently Asked Questions in [the toolkit repository](https://github.com/VIPriors/vipriors-challenges-toolkit). If your question persists, you can ask it on the forums of the specific challenge on the CodaLab website. If you need to ask us a question in private, you can email us at vipriors-ewi AT tudelft DOT nl. -->
