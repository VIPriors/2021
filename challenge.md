We present the **"Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Computer Vision"** challenges. We offer four challenges, where models are to be trained from scratch, and we reduce the number of training samples to a fraction of the full set. The four data-deficient challenges are: 1) ImageNet classification 2) Cityscapes segmentation, 3) MS COCO object detection and 4) UFC-101 action recognition.

- We prohibit the use of other data than the provided training data, i.e., no pre-training, no transfer learning.
- These tasks were chosen to encourage any researcher to participate: no giant GPU clusters are needed.
- We will provide some simple Python tooling to accommodate data generation and submitting results. Results are to be submitted in CSV-format and evaluated on submission.
- Top contenders in the challenge should expect their submissions to be submitted to peer review to ensure reproducability.

*More details will be provided at a later date.*
